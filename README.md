# Spotify-Songs-Genre-Segmentation-and-Recommendation-System-Using-Clustering-and-Machine-Learning




## Overview

This project implements an automated system to segment Spotify songs by genre using clustering and data analysis techniques. Leveraging an open dataset of Spotify tracks, the project explores song features, performs data preprocessing, visualizes essential characteristics, and applies clustering algorithms to assist in music recommendation.

## Objectives

- Perform data pre-processing on the Spotify songs dataset.
- Analyze and visualize song features to gain meaningful insights.
- Compute and display the correlation matrix of the features.
- Identify and visualize clusters based on playlist genres, playlist names, and other parameters.
- Build and evaluate a model to enable a recommendation system.

## Dataset

The dataset includes a collection of Spotify songs with various features such as:

- Track Name
- Artist Name
- Playlist Genre
- Playlist Name
- Acoustic Features (e.g., danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, etc.)

(Provide a link to your dataset here if it is publicly available.)

## Project Workflow

The analysis and modeling steps are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility. The workflow includes:

### 1. Data Pre-processing

- Loading the dataset
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling/standardization

### 2. Data Analysis & Visualization

- Univariate and bivariate analysis of features
- Distribution plots for key features
- Boxplots, violin plots, and histograms
- Analysis by playlist genre and playlist name

### 3. Correlation Matrix

- Computation of the correlation matrix for all numeric features
- Visualization using a heatmap to identify highly correlated features

### 4. Clustering

- Dimensionality reduction (if necessary, e.g., PCA or t-SNE)
- Clustering of songs using algorithms such as KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, or DBSCAN
- Visualization of clusters in 2D/3D plots
- Analysis of clusters by playlist genres and names

### 5. Recommendation Model

- Implementation of a basic recommendation model based on song similarity and cluster membership
- Demonstration of song recommendations for sample inputs

## Results

- Summary of key findings from data analysis and clustering
- Insights into genre and playlist-based segmentation
- Evaluation of the recommendation systemâ€™s effectiveness
